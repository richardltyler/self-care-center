# Self Care Center

## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices.
This webpage displays a random affirmation or mantra of your choice! When you see your message, you can start over by clicking the clear button, and a message will appear tell you that it has cleared the messages.

## A Quick Note to the Project Manager
This README will include all of the challenges that have been completed, but I wanted to use this section to paint a better picture of my experience and what you're seeing here in the code.
First of all, I am clearly not very good at styling. I would have liked to have completed more adventures, but I spent several days stressing out about the styling. That put me off from the functionality until Sunday.
I would like to recognize that I have the attention to detail to see that my styling is off in several ways ("affirmations" should overlap horizontally with the message button, the size of the radio buttons should be smaller, etc.), but I felt that I was spending too much time on the styling and decided to move on.  The lesson learned is to reach out for help a little sooner, even if I feel like everyone is doing better than me. I feel pretty lost on it, but I am very excited to learn more about it.
Secondly, I attempted to complete the adventure that checks for duplicate messages, but did not complete it. You can see the progress in commented code in the main.js file in the CYOA branch that is not pushed to the main page. I know that leaving commented code in like that is bad practice, but I thought you would like to see it.
