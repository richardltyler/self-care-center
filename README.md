# Self Care Center

## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices.
This webpage displays a random affirmation or mantra of your choice! When you see your message, you can start over by clicking the clear button, and a message will appear tell you that it has cleared the messages.
